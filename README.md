- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ruben-MR
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of stuff, one really never stops learning, not to mention when you dedicate to coding and technology in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robotics projects mainly focused on HMI in any field but with a personal preference for healthcare applications.
